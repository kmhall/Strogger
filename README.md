This project was undertaken as a part of the Electrical Engineering Senior Design course at the University of Iowa.

For our project, we created an Android app to analyse and give feedback on running form. The app utilizes Firebase to create and authorize user credentials. Data processing is performed on accelerometer and gyroscope data. Running while holding your phone allows the app to calculate and give feedback on a user's cadence, upper trunk rotation, and excessive arm pumping.
